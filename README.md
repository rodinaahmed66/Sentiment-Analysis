📘 Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM — End-to-End NLP Project

data link "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset"

A complete Sentiment Analysis System built using an LSTM deep learning model, deployed with Streamlit, and trained on the 1.6M Tweets Dataset.
This project demonstrates a full machine-learning workflow: data preparation, preprocessing, training, evaluation, model saving, and app deployment.

🚀 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a given text expresses Positive or Negative sentiment using a trained LSTM neural network.

It includes:

A clean and scalable project structure

Separate modules for training, evaluation, preprocessing, and prediction

A Streamlit web app for real-time sentiment classification

Ready-to-deploy setup for GitHub + Streamlit Cloud

Saved TensorFlow LSTM model & tokenizer

🔍 Model Architecture (LSTM)

The final trained model includes:

Tokenizer → Sequence Conversion

Embedding Layer

LSTM Layer (128 units)

Dense Output Layer + Sigmoid Activation

Why LSTM?

LSTMs capture long-term context in text and perform well for sentiment classification compared to classical ML models.

🧹 Text Preprocessing Pipeline

Defined in src/processing.py:

✔ Convert text to lowercase
✔ Remove URLs
✔ Remove mentions & hashtags
✔ Remove punctuation & digits
✔ Remove extra spaces
✔ Tokenization
✔ Padding/truncation

This ensures the same preprocessing is applied during training & real-time predictions.

🏋️ Training the Model

Run:

```python src/train.py```


This script:

Loads and processes the dataset

Tokenizes and pads text

Trains the LSTM model

Saves:

```
models/lstm_model.h5
models/tokenizer.pkl
models/max_len.txt
```

📊 Model Evaluation

Run:

```python src/evaluate.py```


You will get:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion matrix

Training curves (via utils/plot_history.py)

⚡ Real-Time Sentiment Prediction

Example code from predict.py:
```
model = load_model("models/lstm_model.h5")
tokenizer = joblib.load("models/tokenizer.pkl")
max_len = int(open("models/max_len.txt").read())
```

To test manually:

from predict import predict_sentiment
predict_sentiment("I love this project!")

🌐 Streamlit Web App

Run locally:
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The app:

Accepts input text

Preprocesses it

Predicts sentiment using the LSTM

Displays:

Sentiment label

Model confidence score

🎯 Final Notes

✔ No absolute paths → portable & deployable
✔ models/ paths must remain exactly:

models/lstm_model.h5
models/tokenizer.pkl
models/max_len.txt


✔ The project is fully compatible with GitHub & Streamlit Cloud
✔ Perfect for your portfolio or production demo
